This project demonstrates basic geometry classes (Line, Rectangle, and Square) in C#. It covers operations like calculating line lengths and areas of shapes.

Features
Point2D Class: Represents a 2D point with X and Y coordinates.
Line Class: Calculates the length of a line using two Point2D objects.
Rectangle Class: Calculates the area of a rectangle using two Point2D objects (top-left and bottom-right corners).
Square Class: Inherits from Rectangle and calculates the area of a squ
